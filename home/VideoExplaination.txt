What we want based off the user story:
 As a user, I'd like to post a "include movie petition" (on a separate page)
 in the movie store so that all users can vote on whether they want to see the admin 
 add a certain movie to the catalog.

- Page to hold all petitions
- Ability to create petition
- Ability to vote on petition

Steps:
- create page: python3 manage.py startapp petitions
- Add to /moviesstore/settings.py --> INSTALLED APPS 'petitions'
- Add to /moviesstore/urls.py --> urlpatterns path('petitions/', include('petitions.urls'))   
- In petitions add a urls.py file and add --> path('', views.index, name='petitions.index'),
- Create and define views.py in petitions, include button to add review (Good use of Copilot)
    - Also create the popup to add a review + information and what it will look like when posted

- Create a models.py in petitions
- Save Name, Description, and votes to a database.
- List all petitions currently active

- Make all petitions appear based on the database

- Push to production:
git add .
git commit -m "petitionApp"
git push origin main

- Pull to server
git pull origin main
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
